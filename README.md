## Project Name
## Community Smell Detection Tool


## Overview

Community Smell Detection Tool is a web application solution designed to assist developers in automatically identifying "community smells" within their GitHub repositories. These smells represent patterns of ineffective collaboration, communication, or organizational practices within development teams that can negatively impact project productivity, quality, and timeline. By simply entering the URL of an GitHub repository, developers can analyze their projects for potential community smells and gain actionable insights to improve team dynamics and project outcomes.

This project is built upon and extends the existing [ **CSDetector** ](https://github.com/Nuri22/csDetector) tool, originally created by Nuri Almarimi and others [ **CSDetector Paper** ](https://mkaouer.net/publication/almarimi-2021-csdetector/almarimi-2021-csdetector.pdf). We have transformed the original command-line interface (CLI) tool into a more accessible and user-friendly web application. This web-based version enhances usability and ensures that the tool is available to a broader audience, including those who may not be comfortable with CLI environments.


**Key Features:**

* **Easy-to-use Web Interface:** A user-friendly web interface allows developers to input their GitHub repository URL and receive detailed analysis results with a copy of report as email.

* **Comprehensive Smell Detection:** The tool identifies a wide range of community smells, including:
    * Organizational Silo Effect
    * Black-cloud Effect
    * Prima-donnas Effect
    * Sharing Villainy
    * Organizational Skirmish
    * Solution Defiance
    * Radio Silence
    * Truck Factor Smell
    * Unhealthy Interaction
    * Toxic Communication

* **Actionable Insights:** Detailed reports provide clear explanations of detected smells and other key metrics detected.


**How it Works:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for easy input of GitHub repository URL, PAT, and email address.

2. **Data Extraction:** The tool automatically extracts relevant data from the repository, including commit history, issue tracker, pull requests, and discussions.

3. **Smell Detection:** Advanced algorithms analyze the extracted data to identify potential community smells.

4. **Secure Authentication:**  Utilizes GitHub PAT for secure access to repository data.

5. **Report Generation:** The tool generates detailed reports highlighting the detected smells. It also automatically sends the PDF report to the specified email address.

**Limitations:**

1. **Data Accessibility**: The tool works with repositories that provide proper authentication via GitHub PAT.

2. **Smell Detection Scope:** The tool is currently limited to detecting the specified community smells and does not assess technical or code-related issues within the repository.

3. **GitHub Dependency:** The tool relies on GitHub's API and available data; therefore, any changes to GitHub's API or data structures could affect the toolâ€™s functionality

## System Requirements and Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements and that the necessary tools are installed:

**1. Operating System**
- Windows 10 or higher
- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher

- Allow network access to `localhost` or `0.0.0.0` if running on a server.

**7. GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**
- If the repository requires authentication, you will need a valid GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to clone it. 
- Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) to create a fine-grained PAT.

**8. Repository URL**
-  The URL of project repository to be tested:

**9. Email Address**
- A valid email ID to receive the generated PDF report.

## Installation and Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your system.

**1. Install Python**

Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**2. Clone the GitHub Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/CSCI5308/course-project-g01.git
```
**3. Create a Virtual Environment**

Creating a virtual environment is recommended to isolate the project dependencies from your system's Python installation.

* For Windows and Linux distributions other than Ubuntu/Debian, run:
```
python -m venv cs_venv
```
* For Ubuntu/Debian, use:
```
python3 -m venv cs_venv
```
This will create a virtual environment named cs_venv.

**4. Activate the Virtual Environment**

Activate the virtual environment to start working within it:

* For Bash, ZSH, or Windows shell:
```
source cs_venv/bin/activate
```
* For Fish shell:

```
source cs_venv/bin/activate.fish
```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should change, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

**5. Install Required Python Packages**

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary libraries for the project.

**6. Verify Virtual Environment is Active**

To ensure the virtual environment is activated correctly, you can run:
```
which python
```
This should return the path to the Python executable within the cs_venv directory.

**7. Update the `.env` File**

The project uses environment variables stored in a .env file. You must update this file with your secret keys and Gmail email credentials for SMTP setup.
- 1. Locate the .env file in the project directory (if it doesn't exist, create one).
- 2. Add the following entries:
```
SMTP_EMAIL=<your-gmail-address>
SMTP_PASSWORD=<your-gmail-app-password>
```
Replace <your-gmail-address>, and <your-gmail-app-password> with your actual values.


**8. Start the Application**

To start the application, use the following command:
```
python -m MLbackend.app
```
This will launch the application.

You can access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000

### Design Principles Followed

#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

Each module, class, or function in our code has a single responsibility. This means that each component of the application is designed to perform one specific task or function. By following this principle, we ensure that the system is easier to maintain, test, and extend.

![Single Responsibility Principle](images/screenshot1.jpeg)

#### 2. **Loosely Coupled Methods**

We aimed to design methods that are loosely coupled. This means that each method operates independently of others, with minimal dependencies. This leads to a more flexible and modular system where changes in one method are less likely to affect others.


#### 3. **Modularization**

Our codebase is modularized, meaning the application is broken down into smaller, manageable, and independent modules. Each module is responsible for a specific feature or functionality, making it easier to maintain, test, and extend the application.


#### 4. **No Hierarchy**

We avoided creating complex hierarchies in our application design. Instead, we kept the structure simple and flat, which prevents excessive complexity in navigating and understanding the codebase.


#### 5. **No Interfaces**

We avoided using interfaces in favor of more direct implementation methods. This decision ensures the code remains simple and flexible, with minimal boilerplate and overhead, allowing for faster development and easier modification.


### Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Unit Testing

In this project, we have applied **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for the **Result class**, ensuring that its functionality is thoroughly tested before implementation. The TDD approach ensures that we catch issues early, create clean and maintainable code, and have a solid foundation for future refactoring.

In addition to TDD for the Result class, we have also written **unit tests** for other classes to verify the functionality of various components of the application. These unit tests help ensure that each class performs its intended function correctly and that changes or additions to the codebase do not break existing functionality.

---

### Test Coverage

The following image shows the **test coverage** for each class in the project. It provides a breakdown of which parts of the code are tested and how much of the codebase is covered by our tests.

![TDD](images/tdd.jpeg)


*Screenshot of the test coverage for each class.*

As shown in the image, we strive to maintain high test coverage to ensure that our application remains robust and reliable. The coverage data helps us identify areas that require more tests and maintain the quality of the application.
